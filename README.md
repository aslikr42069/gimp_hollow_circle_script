# Hollow Circle
A script for making a hollow circle in GIMP, which normally is kind of a pain. 

# Why?
Because I saw a post making fun of GIMP users because it's not always apparent to new users of GIMP as to how one would make a hollow circle, so I decided to make a little script that automates the process.

# Installing
On Linux and \*BSD, you just have to copy the filled_ellipse.scm to ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/scripts, replacing the 2.10 with whatever version you have.

# Using
To use, simply use the rectangular selection tool to select some area, then click on File -> Create -> Draw an Ellipse. It'll ask you for the radius of the outline of the hollowed-out ellipse. The default is usually fine, though playing around with the option is always fun.
